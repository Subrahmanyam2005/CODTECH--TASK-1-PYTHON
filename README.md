Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Python calculator code:

1. Function Definitions for Operations:

The program begins by defining four functions for each basic arithmetic operation: add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide().

add(x, y): Takes two arguments (x and y) and returns their sum.

subtract(x, y): Takes two arguments and returns the difference (x - y).

multiply(x, y): Takes two arguments and returns the product.

divide(x, y): Checks if y is zero before dividing; if not, it returns the quotient of x divided by y. If y is zero, it returns an error message to handle division by zero.




2. Main Calculator Function:

The main function, calculator(), contains the core logic of the program. It starts by displaying a menu of operations:

1. Add

2. Subtract

3. Multiply

4. Divide


The program then prompts the user to choose an operation by entering a number from 1 to 4.



3. Input Validation and Operation Selection:

After receiving the user’s choice, the program checks if the input is valid by comparing it to the allowed choices ('1', '2', '3', and '4').

If the user input is invalid (not in this range), it displays an error message, prompting the user to select a valid option.



4. Inputting Numbers:

If the user’s choice is valid, the program then asks for two numbers (operands) to perform the selected operation. The input() function is used to capture these values, which are then converted to float to handle both integers and decimal numbers.



5. Performing the Operation and Displaying the Result:

Based on the chosen operation, the program calls the corresponding function:

If the user chose '1', it performs addition and calls add(num1, num2).

If the user chose '2', it performs subtraction by calling subtract(num1, num2).

If the user chose '3', it performs multiplication by calling multiply(num1, num2).

If the user chose '4', it performs division by calling divide(num1, num2).


The result of the operation is then displayed to the user in a formatted string, showing both the input numbers and the result.



6. Running the Program:

At the bottom of the code, calculator() is called to run the program when it is executed. This function initiates the interaction with the user, allowing them to use the calculator.




Example Usage

If the user wants to add 5 and 3:

They would enter 1 for addition.

Enter 5 as the first number and 3 as the second.

The program outputs: 5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0.


This code provides a simple yet effective command-line calculator capable of handling basic arithmetic. It also includes error handling for invalid choices and division by zero.
